# Async adapter only works within the same process, so for manually triggering cable updates from a console,
# and seeing results in the browser, you must do so from the web console (running inside the dev process),
# not a terminal started via bin/rails console! Add "console" to any action or any ERB template view
# to make the web console appear.
development:
  adapter: async

test:
  adapter: test

# Using async to avoid SolidCable trying to use a separate "cable" database
# disabled multi db cable connection casuee redner free only supports 1 db
